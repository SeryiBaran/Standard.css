# Standard.css [![](https://data.jsdelivr.com/v1/package/gh/SeryiBaran/Standard.css/badge)](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/gh/SeryiBaran/Standard.css)
This is a CSS library for normalize styles, based on Normalize.css.  
Usage is the same as [Normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css), [Reset.css](https://gist.github.com/DavidWells/18e73022e723037a50d6) and others CSS libraries.  
This library contains all the advantages of Normalize.css and adds very frequently used styles.
